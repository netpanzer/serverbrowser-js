# GamesNet Panzer Browser

GamesNet Panzer Browser is a Node.js application that allows NetPanzer players to view information about available game servers. It connects to master servers, collects information about game servers, and displays this information on a simple web page.

## How It Works

The GamesNet Panzer Browser application operates as follows:

1. It connects to master servers to obtain a list of available NetPanzer game servers.

2. It parses the list of game servers to extract information such as IP address, port, and other relevant details.

3. It starts a local HTTP server to display this information on a web page.

4. Periodically, it updates game server information to ensure that players always have access to up-to-date information.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Clone or download this repository.

3. Open a terminal in the project folder and run the following command to install dependencies:

## npm install


## start

1. Start the game browser by running the following command:

 "node app.js" 

 
2. Open a web browser and access `http://localhost:8080` to see the list of available game servers.

3. The web page will automatically refresh every 30 seconds to display updated game server information.


## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the web page by editing the `app.js` file and the `createHTMLTable()` function. You can also add more master servers to the `this.masterservers` array in the `GamesNetPanzerBrowser` class constructor if needed.
