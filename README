1. Introduction
The php-netPanzer-Serverbrowser lets you find netPanzer games on the internet.
Games are displayed in a nice html interface. If you use a newer netPanzer version
(0.8 and newer) on Windows you can yoin a game by klicking the servername.

Php-netPanzer-Serverbrowser is based on the  php-netPanzer-Toolbox which is a
collection of classes and scripts supplying methods to query the masterserver network,
query gameservers, display map images,.... . 

1.1 License
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
See COPYING for more details.

1.2 Used/needed libraries
netPanzer - Browser uses PEAR Cache_Lite to cache an entire dataset. This is necessary
cause of some unreachable (behind firewalls) or crashed servers. The Smarty template
system is used to display the data.

Smarty is included in this release. So you only need to install PEAR Lite_Cache.

Web resources:
PEAR / Cache_Lite: 	http://pear.php.net/package/Cache_Lite
Smarty:				http://smarty.php.net
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. Installation
Unzip the files contents in any dir on your web server. Make sure the script is allowed
to write in the cache directory. Make sure you have php, PEAR and PEAR Cache_Lite
installed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.1 Usage
You use the script by simply calling it with your webbrowser. By default it refreshes
itsself every 45 seconds. The data cache gets refreshed every 60 seconds. Both values
might be changed in the configuration section of index.php .

	Viewing debug output:
If you want to view the debug output, call index.php?raw=1 .

	Doing a manual refresh:
You can manually refresh the server dataset by calling index.php?refresh=1 .

3. Configuration:
Configuration is divided into to parts. The global configuration in web.conf.php and a
special configuration part in every file. Global configuration gets overriden.

If you have problems understanding the configuration, simply contact me.
