// php - netPanzer - Toolbox - TODO //

// Unassigned wishes:
	- none

// Wishes with development status:
	// For me more useful would be number of free/owned outposts in general and for every player. + time to the end of the round:
		// State:
			- This data is now sent by newer servers. The number of outposts in displyed in the template. Time is also sent.
			- The script assigns every new value automatically. All you have to do is  modifying the template.
	
	// Add logparsing capabilities:
		// State:
			- Logs can be parsed and analyzed.
			- Logdata gets stored in the database.
			- Created some output templates.
		// TODO:
			- Create a nice application that parses new logs.
			- Create a nice templateset for output data.
			- Add bot-filter.

// DONE:
	- Create FlagID to flagname converter.
	- Add map-info page (Map image, number/names of outposts, number of spawns).
	- Add caching information to getimage.php .
